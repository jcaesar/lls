lls - list listening sockets / listening ls
Julius Michaelis <lls@liftm.de>

USAGE:
    lls
    lls has no command-line options

OUTPUT:
    lls outputs a tree of listening sockets, grouped by process and port, e.g.:
    
    sshd (pid 137 user root)
    └ :22 tcp
      └ 0.0.0.0 + ::
    
    The output parts are as follows:

    {process name} (pid {process id} user {user name or id})
    └ :{port} {transport protocol}
      └ {listening address} ({interface})
    
    Groups with only one child are collapsed into a single line.
    The initial example is thus actually displayed as:
    
    sshd (pid 137 user root) / :22 tcp / 0.0.0.0 + ::
